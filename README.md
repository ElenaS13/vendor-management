# Vendor Management Application

This applicaton is based on the tutorial by Imtiaz Ahmad for Project Management application. 
I adopted this application to create a program for the small business owned by my family to record vendors that we work with and product IDs that they supply us with. 

## The project leverages the following:

- Spring boot
- Thymeleaf
- PostgreSQL
- Hibernate
- Spring Security
- RESTFUL Web Services API
- Spring MVC 
- Docker
