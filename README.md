# vendor-management application

This applicaton is based on the tutorial by Imtiaz Ahmad for Project Management application. 
I adopted this application to create a program for a small business owned by my family to record vendors that we work with and product IDs that they supply us with. 

The project uses the following:

-Spring boot
-Thymeleaf
-PostgreSQL
-Hibernate
-Spring Security
-RESTFUL Web Services API
-Spring MVC 
-Docker
